## Ropecon 2023

In Ropecon 2023, Konsti is used to sign up for role-playing games, larps, tournaments, workshops and some other program items.

The Gaming Desk (Hall 3) and the Larp & RPG Desk (southern entrance lobby) will help you with using Konsti. The desks also have shared computers for using Konsti.

## How do you use Konsti?

Konsti is a web application that can be used on any web browser on your own device, such as a smartphone, a tablet or a laptop.

### Registering and logging in

You can browse the [program list](/program/list) without logging in, but for registering to
program a user account is needed. Accounts from previous years have been removed, so you
will have to create a new one for this year's Ropecon.

For creating an account, you will need a registration code, which you can get from the
Gaming Desk (Hall 3), the Larp & RPG Desk or the Info Desk (both in the southern entrance lobby).

You can create your account on the [registration page](/registration).

Please save your registration code: you will need it if you log out of Konsti and then need
to change your password. The code is visible in Konsti after you first log in. Later, you
can see it on the [profile page](/profile/profile).

### Browsing program

The [program list page](/program/list) displays all program that uses Konsti for sign-ups.
If the sign-up period for a given program item is not open yet, the info text for it will
show when the sign-up starts and whether it will be a lottery sign-up or a direct sign-up.

On the page, you can also see other information, such as the duration of the program item,
its location and accessibility information. You can also see how many people have signed
up, and how many spots there are still open.

When a program item uses direct sign-up, the number of participants is updated in real time.
For games that use lottery sign-up, the number will not change until the lottery sign-up
period is over and the algorithm has allocated users to games.

### Favorited program

Favoriting program items is a good way to keep track of program you find interesting. You can add a program item to your favorites by clicking on the heart icon in the upper right corner of a program item's info card. You can find your favorites in the [My Program view](/program/myprogram).

### Groups

You can sign up to role-playing games also as a member of a group. Then, the lottery algorithm will assign all members of the group to the same game. For games with more
sign-ups than places, it is of course possible that the group will not get a spot in the
game at all.

You can create a group on the [group page](/profile/group). There, you can also join an
existing group, for which you will need a registration code from the person who created
the group. Only the group creator can sign up the group to games.

If you already have direct sign-ups to games, you can't create a new group or join an
existing one. These sign-ups will be shown on the group page.

## Signing up to program

If the sign-up period for a program item is ongoing, a sign-up button will be shown on the item's info card. You can cancel your sign-up on either the [My Program page](/program/myprogram) or the [program list](/program/list).

The sign-up occurs at different times for different program items. You can see when a sign-up starts on the program list or on this info page.

Tabletop role-playing games use a lottery sign-up where, after the lottery, remaining slots will be filled in the order of sign-ups. All other program uses direct sign-up without a lottery phase.

## Tabletop role-playing game sign-ups

Tabletop RPG sign-up in Konsti happens in two phases: lottery and direct sign-up. The lottery phase uses an algorithm to assign users to games while taking into account the preferences they have chosen for the games they have signed up for. The phase starts four
hours before a game begins, except for the first games on Saturday and Sunday mornings,
for which the sign-up starts the night before. In this first phase, you can choose up to three games for each time slot.

The lottery sign-up phase lasts for 2 hours, after which the Konsti algorithm places users into games based on their chosen preferences. After this initial placement, signing up for games is closed for 15 minutes. During this "intermission period" you can take a look at the results of the lottery sign-up, and decide whether you want to participate in the second phase of the sign-up process or not.

After the initial placements and the 15-minute intermission period, the direct sign-up phase begins. During the last 1h 45 min before the game is set to begin, you can sign up for a game as long as there is still room for new players. You do not need to participate in the lottery sign-up phase to be able to sign up during the direct sign-up period.

The first games of the convention, which start on Friday at 4PM and 5PM, only have the direct sign-up phase.

### Revolving door games

Revolving door games are games where players can freely join and leave the game session at any time while it's going on. The first players can sign up for these games as usual, but after the revolving door games begin, they are displayed in the program list for their whole duration.

## Larp sign-ups

Unlike tabletop rgps, larp sign-ups do not use a lottery and only contain one phase.

There are some larps where sign-up does not happen in Konsti. You can sign up to these
games at the Larp & RPG Desk, because the players may have to, for example, select
a character during sign-up.

### Sign-up period start times for larps

- Larps on Friday: Friday 3PM
- Larps starting early on Saturday: Friday 6PM
- Larps starting later on Saturday: Saturday 11AM
- Larps on Sunday: Saturday 3PM

## Tournament sign-ups

Tournament sign-ups also do not use a lottery and only contain one phase. Some tournaments
may not use Konsti for signing up. If you can't find a tournament in Konsti and don't know
how to sign up, you can ask for help at the game desk.

### Sign-up period start times for tournaments

- Friday's tournaments: Friday 3PM
- Saturday's tournaments: Friday 6PM
- Sunday's tournaments: Saturday 6PM

### Contact information

When signing up for a tournament via the Konsti app, the user is prompted to fill in their name and contact information (email and phone number) before confirming their signup. This is done to make sure that tournament organizers can get a hold of the winners and other possible prize recipients after the tournament. This information is
not shown to other Konsti users, only to Ropecon desk staff, who will pass on necessary
contact information to tournament organizers.

## Workshops and other program

In 2023, many workshops and some other program items are signed up to in Konsti. These
also use direct sign-up, which means that places are filled in the order of sign-ups.

### Sign-up period start times for workshops

- Workshops starting on Friday: Friday 3PM
- Workshops starting on Saturday on or before 2PM: Friday 6PM
- Workshops starting on Saturday after 2PM: Saturday 9AM
