## I need help with the Konsti app, who can I ask?

Our volunteers at both the Gaming Desk as well as the Larp & RPG Desk will gladly assist you and help you sign up for games using the Konsti app. If you have any questions about the Konsti app or how to use it, do not hesitate to ask them for help!

## I want to start using Konsti - where do I begin?

To begin using the Konsti app, you need to first register an account, which you can do on the [registration page](/registration).

To register an account you need a registration code and you will also have come up with a username
and password. After registering an account and logging in you can sign up to program. You can use your Konsti account on any device by logging in.

Please note that accounts from previous years are no longer in use.

## Where can I get a registration code?

Registration codes can be picked up at either the Gaming Desk (Hall 5), at the Larp & RPG Desk or at the Info desk (both in the Southern Entrance lobby). This means that you cannot create a new account before Ropecon begins on Friday.

## How do I change my password?

If you are logged in to Konsti, you can change your password in the [Profile view](/profile/profile).

If you have lost your password, you can request it to be changed either at the Gaming Desk or at the Larp & RPG Desk, if you still have both your registration code and your username.

If you lost your password before signing up for any program, you can just pick up another registration code and create a new account.

## I do not have a mobile device, how do I sign up?

There are shared computers on both the Gaming Desk and the Larp & RPG Desk that you can use
Konsti with. Just remember to log out when you are done!

## Why can't I find a certain program item in Konsti?

Have you checked that you have selected the correct programme type in the selector? It can also be useful to check which tag is selected, as they can also filter the list of games that are visible.

If you still cannot find the game or tournament you are looking for, it is possible that the sign-up process for that particular game or tournament is not done via the Konsti app but in some other way. If you are unsure, you can always confirm the sign-up method for a certain game or tournament from the Gaming Desk, the Larp & RPG Desk or the Info desk.

## Why can I not sign up for a program item even though it's visible in Konsti?

Option A: You have already signed up for three role-playing games in the same starting time slot during the lottery sign-up phase. When signing up for role-playing games using the Konsti app, it is possible to sign up for up to three games during the lottery sign-up phase, which begins 4 hours before the starting time of the game in question, or during the following direct sign-up phase 2 hours before the game is set to start. In the lottery sign-up phase, the user can choose up to three games and assign them in the order of preference from 1 to 3. You can only choose three, so there might be some tough choices ahead!

Please note that signing up for a game in one program type does not prevent you from signing up for a game in another program type: you can still sign up for a larp or a tournament even if you have already signed up for a role-playing game. Please make sure that you do not sign up for games or tournaments that are held at the same time and can actually attend the ones you sign up for!

Option B: It happens to be the "intermission period": when signing up for role-playing games, there is a 15 min "intermission period" between the first lottery sign-up phase and the second direct sign-up phase when signing up for games is not possible at all. If it is 2 hours before the role-playing game is set to start and the lottery sign-up phase has just concluded, it is possible that the intermission period is currently active. If this is the case, the issue will soon resolve itself as the sign-up process will resume after 15 minutes.

Option C: The leader of your group has signed you up for a role-playing game as a part of a group in the lottery sign-up, which prevents you from signing up for any other games as long as you are a member of the group. If you try to sign up for a game while being a member of a group, Konsti will display a warning: confirming the choice despite the warning will remove you from the group. If you are the group leader and you try to sign up for a game using direct sign-up, the group will be disbanded (a warning will be displayed for this one beforehand, as well).

## Why can I not create or join a group?

You cannot create a new group or join a group if you have already signed up for games. You can check which games are preventing you from creating or joining a group in the [Group view](/profile/group).

## Can I sign up for multiple simultaneous program item?

It is technically possible to sign up for multiple games, e.g. two slightly overlapping game tournaments using the Konsti app. Sometimes this can be useful, for example when another tournament would be starting a little bit before another one ends and the user would like to participate in both knowing that the first tournament will probably end early, or if they do not make it to the final round. Technically, allowing for multiple sign-ups at the same time also makes it possible for users to sign up for a different game if the game or tournament is canceled entirely. However, this is a power that should be used wisely and with care: please make sure to check that you are not signing up for multiple games or tournaments held at the same time, and that you can actually attend all the games and tournaments that you sign up for!

Additionally, since signing up for a game in one programme type does not prevent the user from signing up for a game in another programme type in the same time slot, it is technically possible to accidentally sign up for e.g. both a tabletop role-playing game and a larp held at the same time. Please make sure that you only sign up for one game or tournament per slot and that you can actually attend the games and tournaments you sign up for!

## Why wasn't I signed up for the game I tried to sign up for?

When signing up for role-playing games using the Konsti app, there is first a lottery sign-up phase where the user signs up for up to three games and the algorithm assigns users into games. However, a lottery sign-up does not necessarily guarantee a place in any of the games you have chosen: it simply means that you have signed up to take part in the lottery executed by the algorithm. When the initial algorithmic placement is over, there can sometimes unfortunately be some users that have not secured a spot in a game of their choice - this can sometimes be the case, especially with very popular games. However, there is still a chance to find a game for the upcoming time slot and sign up for it during the direct sign-up phase.

## I can't make it to the game I signed up for, what do I do now?

If you cannot make it to the game or tournament you have signed up for via the Konsti app and the sign-up period is still ongoing, please make sure to cancel your sign-up as soon as possible: this way someone else will have a chance to sign up for the game and fill your seat!
