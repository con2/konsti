### Privacy policy

Data controller is Arttu Hanska (email: arttu.hanska@gmail.com). This privacy policy deals with Konsti signup application's user information. The reason for handling this data is to allow event signup at conventions using the system.

The following information will be saved:

- A unique user ID of your choice (visible to registered users)
- Username password hash
- Information about selected games: favorites, signed games
- Other users with whom the user has formed a group
- Open text information, like name, email or phone number. Event organizers can use this information to contact participants.
- Usage logs with timestamps and IP address

The registry information origin is from the registered themself. Registry information can be given to the organizers of the specific convention.

The registry resides in the Unites States at Amazon corporation's AWS cloud service platform (https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/).

Personally identifiable information is removed from the system after the event. Non-personally identifiable information may be published for statistical purposes.

Registry information is secured with technical security measures (for example, user restricted access, cryptographic password hashing, and encrypted data transfer).
