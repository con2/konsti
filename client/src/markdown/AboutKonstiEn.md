### What is Konsti?

Konsti app is an [open-source sign-up application](https://github.com/ropekonsti/konsti) designed for Finnish conventions developed and maintained by a group of volunteer programmers. Konsti has been in use at Ropecon since 2017 and initially only used for role-playing game sign-ups. Signing up for games via the app can be done either by a lottery, or directly in the order of enrollment.
