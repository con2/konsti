# What is Konsti app?

Konsti app is an [open-source sign-up application](https://github.com/ropekonsti/konsti) designed for Finnish conventions developed and maintained by a group of volunteer programmers. Konsti has been in use at Ropecon since 2017. Signing up for games via the app can be done either by a lottery, or directly in the order of enrollment. The team has continued to work on and improve the Konsti app and its lottery algorithm throughout the years.

## Ropecon 2022

In Ropecon 2022, you can sign-up to tabletop role-playing games, larps, and game tournaments in Konsti.

Gaming Desk (Hall 3) and Larp/RPG Desk (Southern Entrance lobby) will help you with using Konsti. You can also get registration code or borrow tablets to use Konsti from the desks.

## How do you use Konsti?

Konsti is a web application that can be used on any web browser on your own device such as a smartphone, a tablet or a laptop.

### Registering and logging in

You can register a new account, log in and return back to the list of games through the hamburger menu on the upper left corner of Konsti. You can browse Konsti and all the games without logging in, but you will need to register an account and log in to be able to sign up for any games.

To register a new account, you will need a registration code. Registration codes are available at the venue during Ropecon: you can get your code either at the Gaming Desk (Hall 3) or at the Larp/RPG Desk (Southern Entrance lobby).

Please note, that any accounts that may have been registered in previous years are no longer in use: you will have to create a new account to use Konsti in Ropecon 2022.

In addition to the registration code, you need to register a new account is an username and a password. It is recommended to hold on to the registration code in case you won't be able to log back in to your account for some reason: you will need the registration code to be able to change the password at one of the desks. When you are first logged in to Konsti, you can see your registration code at the top of the page. It can later be found in the side navigation menu as well.

### Programme type selector

At the top of the page on the left is a new selector that lets you choose which types of games you want to browse: tabletop role-playing games, larps or game tournaments.

Please note that selecting a programme type affects not only the list of games to browse on the main view of the app, but also what games are visible when browsing the games you have signed up for or favorited in the My Games section: only games from one programme type are visible at once.

### Browsing games in the Konsti app

All games -page shows the list of games the user can sign up for via the Konsti app. Games are sorted by their starting time and listed underneath headers displaying the date, the starting time of the game, and the number of games you have signed up for within that time slot. If the sign-up has not yet started, the header will also display when the sign-up period takes place and whether it will be a lottery sign-up or a direct sign-up.

Next is perhaps the most important information for the users of Konsti: how many people have already signed up for the game and how many can still sign up. In the case of direct sign-ups, the number of people signed up for each game is updated and visible in real-time. However, when signing up for role-playing games using the lottery sign-up, if the lottery sign-up period is still ongoing, this number will not change until the lottery sign-up period is over and the algorithm has allocated users in games.

At the bottom of the info card of each game there is a Read more link. Clicking the link will display more detailed information about the selected game, such as the duration and location of the game, accessibility information and the description of the game.

### Signing up for games

If the sign-up period for a game is ongoing, a Sign-up or Lottery sign-up button can be seen at the bottom of the game's info card. As long as the game has not yet started, you can cancel your sign-up for a game either from the game list or from the My Games section in the side navigation bar by pressing the Cancel sign-up button.

Different types of game programme have slightly different sign-up processes due to the nature of their games.

### Favorited games

Adding games and tournaments to your favorites in Konsti is a great way to keep track of games that you find interesting: you can browse the games you have favorited later through the My Games section in the navigation sidebar. You can add games to favorites from the game list by clicking the heart icon located in the upper right corner of the game's info card.

## How to sign up for role-playing games?

Signing up for role-playing games using the Konsti app contains two phases: the first one is called "lottery", and the second one "direct sign-up". Similar to previous years, the lottery phase uses an algorithm to assign users to games while taking into account the preferences they have chosen for the games they have signed up for. However, this year there is a new addition to the sign-up process, the direct sign-up phase.

The sign-up period for role-playing games begins 4 hours before each game is set to begin with the lottery sign-up phase: during the first 2 hours the user can sign up to a maximum of three games per starting time slot and place them in order of preference. After the 2 hour lottery sign-up period is over, the algorithm places the users into games based on their chosen preferences and the capacity of the games. After this initial placement, signing up for games is closed for 15 minutes: during this "intermission period" the user can check the results of the lottery sign-up and decide whether they want to participate in the 2nd phase of the sign-up process or not.

After the initial placements and the 15 minute intermission period, the second phase or the direct sign-up phase begins. Within the last 1h 45 min before the game is set to begin users have a chance to sign up to a game as long as there is still room for new players. Please note that you do not need to participate in the lottery sign-up phase to be able to sign up during the direct sign-up period!

### Revolving door games

Revolving door games are games, where players can freely join and leave the role-playing game session at any time during its runtime. In the Konsti app, the first players can sign up for these games as usual, but after the revolving door games begin, they are displayed in their own section at the top of the page when clicking the "Revolving door" button.

## How to sign up for larps?

This year, sign-up for the majority of larps is done via the Konsti app. Unlike the sign-up process for table-top role-playing games, larp sign-ups do not use the lottery sign-up system: instead, players are signed up for games directly in the order of enrollment.

### Sign-up periods for larps

There are set sign-up periods for larps. When using the Konsti app, the sign-up period for Friday night's larps begins at 3pm as soon as Ropecon opens its doors. Similarly, the sign-up period for larps held from Saturday morning to afternoon will begin on Friday at 6pm, and the sign-up period for larps held on Saturday evening will begin at 11am on Saturday. Finally, for larps held on Sunday, the sign-up period will begin on Saturday at 3pm.

### Why is larp X not in the Konsti app?

Please note that there are some larps in the Ropecon 2022 programme that you cannot sign up for via the Konsti app. For example, some games may need to have their sign-ups at the Larp/RPG Desk due to having to distribute additional materials to the players or have them select their character at the time of sign-up.

## How to sign up for game tournaments?

You can browse and sign up for game tournaments within the Konsti app by selecting Game tournaments from the programme type selector at the top of the page. The sign-up process is fairly similar to those of larps and role-playing games, with some notable exceptions:

### Game tournaments only use direct sign-ups

Unlike when signing up for role-playing games using the Konsti app, there is no lottery-signup or algorithm at play. Just like larps, game tournaments also use direct sign-ups, which means that users are signed up for tournaments in the order of enrollment. This is why, especially in the case of smaller or more popular tournaments, we recommend signing up for tournaments well in advance to be able to secure a spot.

### Sign-up period for game tournaments

The sign-up period within the Konsti app is also a little bit different for game tournaments. Unlike with larps or role-playing games, the sign-up process for all game tournaments begins as soon as Ropecon opens its doors at 3pm on Friday and remains open until the game tournament in question begins.

### Remember to fill in your contact information to receive prizes

When signing up for a game tournament via the Konsti app, the user is prompted to fill in their name and contact information (email and phone number) before confirming their signup. This is done to make sure that tournament organizers can get a hold of the winners and other possible prize recipients after the tournament - you would be surprised by how difficult this has sometimes been! This information is not shown publicly to other users of the Konsti app and is only visible for the organizers of the game tournament. Please make sure to fill in this information carefully so the prizes will find their way to their proper recipients!

### Why is tournament X not in the Konsti app?

Although a variety of different game tournaments are held at Ropecon 2022, not all of them use the Konsti app for their sign-up process. For example, some tournaments like most of the miniature figure tournaments have already had a sign-up process well in advance via their own forums, and many of the MTG tournaments held at Ropecon use their own companion app for their sign-ups. Additionally, the Vampire: the Eternal Struggle European Championships held at Ropecon 2022 require their own in-person sign-up process at the VTES tournament area in Room 208 of Siipi.

If you have any questions about which game tournaments use the Konsti app for their sign-up, or how to sign up via the Konsti app, please do not hesitate to ask for help at the Gaming Desk - our volunteers will gladly help you out!
