Konsti is an open-source sign-up application designed for Finnish conventions, developed and maintained by a group of
volunteer programmers. Konsti has been in use at Ropecon since 2017. Signing up for games via the app can be done either
by a lottery, or directly in the order of enrollment.

The team has continued to work on and improve the Konsti app and
its lottery algorithm throughout the years.
