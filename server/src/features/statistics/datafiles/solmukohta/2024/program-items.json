    "description": "Throughout the 20th century, the mask has been developed as an effective tool for performance. Michel St Denis, Jacques Lecoq and John Wright have developed the imagination through different mask styles and traditions with a focus on transformation of the persona. Story living within the framework of an imaginary or alternate world asks the participant to embrace the persona and thematic world of the setting and the emotional levels of the Larp’s levels of energy. This is especially true within historical or fantasy larps where the magical or combat systems of the world, ask one to rise up into a archetype that may not be familiar to the participant. The temperament mask may support  finding a means to embody character in a new and rich way. In a workshop using masks I will invite attendees to explore the depth of the temperaments using a special set of masks of based in ancient archetypes of  four essential temperaments. \r\n\r\nWe all have all four within us but usually one predominates and through exercises applying these masks players will become more self-aware, developing flexibility with making choices in how to create and perform different characters. Using these masks, characters can be accessed with great energy and commitment. Understanding your character from within their temperament, based on the “humors” of the Greek scientist Galen, you’ll be initiated into a richer start into your role than the text may give you – through the persona raised from the mask you will form a deeper courage to commit to a given moment  with a clearer picture of what you might say or do while in-play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Four Temperaments: \r\n•\tCHOLERIC, extroverted, will-oriented people, always striving passionately towards the future and associated with the element of fire.\r\n•\tSANGUINE, flighty, mobile people, with humor and flexibility and a propensity to chaos. This extroverted type, living in the present, is associated with the element of air.\r\n•\tPHLEGMATIC, conservative, and faithful, they can be good followers. These introverted types, living in the present, are associated with the element of water.\r\n•\tMELANCHOLIC, serious, and introspective, living in the past. Associated with the element of earth, the melancholic never forgets.\r\n\r\nThe masks were created by Mike Chase for training, education, performance, and therapy which are used internationally by theatres and theatre companies including the RSC, the National Theatre, LAMDA, and Trestle theatre. He also developed the application of masks for a  therapeutic program for young adults with complex needs.",

Many people find SketchUp easier to navigate using a mouse than a trackpad, but it is not necessary. I will not be using one myself.\r\n\r\nFor anyone worried about system requirements, the workshop will be run from a 2017 PowerMac.\r\n\r\nSketchUp can be downloaded here: https://help.sketchup.com/en/admin/sketchup-free",

Through different scenes the group then explores how they can support each player's dance thereby generating material for the final performance. \r\nThe larp is a mix between wordless movement scenes and verbal scenes with focus on discussing the dances and how to support each other.",

The ever-growing misery as the years go by and all they see outside of the spacecraft is endless unchanging night and, finally, their quiet deaths.\r\n \r\nThe larp is inspired and heavily influenced by the book Aniara – a review about man in time and space by Swedish author Harry Martinsson, and the 2018 movie Aniara based on Martinsson’s book.\n\nContent warnings: Loud noises, Flashing lights, Death, religion",

Forming new languages of world-building and relationship-building you will collectively write and share stories that shall accompany you on this journey.

    "description": "History has always been a popular setting for larping. Whether that be regency period drama, vikings, World War II or the gay scene in 1980s New York, the past has provided larp with a rich fount of inspiration. History can provide setting, costume, characters or plot; it can be a playground and a tool for exploring the worlds and voices of the historically underprivileged, or the extremely powerful. \r\n\r\nBut what exactly *is* a historical larp? And what is it that we do when we larp in a historical setting? A historical larp can range all the way from a vaguely historical setting in \"the vintage era\" to 360-larps with high ambitions on immersion and historical realism. The points of views which can be explored from a historical perspective are almost infinite. Given this variety, is there a common thread to all of these larps? \r\n\r\nWhen we engage in historical larping, is there something which separates historical larping from other genres of larp? What does historical larping say about our view of history, and can we learn anything about history from larping?\r\n\r\nJoin us to discuss these and other related questions at a round table moderated by James Lancaster, a larper and a PhD student of history at Örebro university in Sweden with a keen interest in how history can be used as a cultural and emphatic tool of understanding. The moderator will host a brief introduction to the subject, before the round table begins.",

Let's use that actively!\r\n\r\nKai loves the physical acting part of larping. In this playful workshop, he will focus on body posture, movement and use of space to draw attention to some of the ways we can use our bodies to enhance our play - both for us and our co-players.",

And when do I have to bring my partcipants to the emergency room, and when can I easily treat them at the location?\r\nIn this workshop you will learn about different levels of burns and how to treat them, how to recognize a fracture and what to do with it and how to treat a wound. I will show some rules of thumb when to go to the emergency room and when not.\r\nAdditionally I want to introduce what a good extended first aid kit should contain and how to use the materials.\r\nThis will not make you a medical doctor unfortunately but hopefully will help you in case an injury happens next time far away from civilization.\n\nContent warnings: Depictions of wounds (inlcuding bones showing out), broken bones, blood, burns and needles",

Today they are inhabiting these bodies to cleanse and ready them for new borrowers. The larp will have a workshop where we go through how we will play the larp and create characters together.

    "description": "Note: If you have signed up for DEBUG.ME in Konsti, we recommend you also answer the casting questionnaire so that you can receive your character in advance: https://forms.gle/XRiMP2HjKYP4ZxXb9\r\n\r\nDEBUG.ME is a multimedia, slice-of-life / psychological horror American freeform larp with litform and Nordic influences. It’s set in a residential treatment facility for maladjusted artificial / synthetic intelligences. In a future where sentient AI has no recognition or “human” rights from any government, the fields of psychotherapy and technical support have begun to converge. The PCs are institutionalized here, willingly or not, because they cannot or will not meet the expectations of the human decision-makers in their lives. Infantilized, enslaved, or both, they are nonetheless expected to change to suit the expectations of a society that still barely even considers them people. If they do not or cannot, they are branded with official-sounding diagnoses that may describe their problem in a biased way, but do little or nothing to help solve it.\r\n\r\nPCs must try to gather what information they can they can from doctors who don’t understand their existence; a sympathetic group therapist with little institutional power; and a janitor bot who may be more than he seems. Perhaps they will learn more from each other, but each situation seems so different from the others. To get out, there are two options: act like you’ve changed (whether or not it’s true), or become a test subject for unproven “therapies”. Most PCs want to feel better, without allowing any radical medical procedures on themselves. Some are very angry, because they know they don't belong here.\r\n\r\nDEBUG.ME explores themes of incarceration, slavery, dehumanization, the uncanny valley, the trolley and ship of Theseus problems, and the relative strengths of the neurodiversity paradigm (or any socially-constructed disability model) over the medical model of mental illness. Each character is loosely based on someone from a popular science fiction story, book, movie, TV show, or game, listed on the character sheet for additional background. Most character sheets are 1 to 2 pages. While the vast majority of characters have synthetic bodies, a few are organic or mostly organic.\r\n\r\nContent warnings: Some characters have sexual assault or other forms of violence in their backstory. At least one killed their rapist. Also, this game is based on the author's experiences in several different psych wards, ranging from scary to mediocre to pretty supportive. The one in this game is run better than any of those, but only a little. The doctors are entirely off screen, both to help minimize unwanted bleed and because they might actually be scarier that way. But even without them, when you are in character you will notice the freedoms you are missing.",
